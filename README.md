# Knights_tour
Visualize a knight's tour for a grid of size 8m*8n:

The CPP program writes the sequence of cells to be traversed for a complete knight tour in bug.txt.
The Python program reads the bug.txt file to visualize the path.

The path for an 8*8 grid is initially computed using backtracking and depth-first search traversal algorithm.

The main task here is to use Object Oriented Programming to represent cells of the grid along with their properties(the two adjacent cells,i.e., the previous cell and the next cell) which will be useful to interconnect the 8*8 grids among themselves.
